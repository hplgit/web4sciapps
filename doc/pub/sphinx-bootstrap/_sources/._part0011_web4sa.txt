User-provided validation  (1)
-----------------------------




.. index::
   single: Flask; input validation



The ``FloatField`` objects can check that the input is compatible with
a number, but what if we want to control that :math:`A>0`, :math:`b>0`, and
:math:`T` is not greater than 30 periods (otherwise the plot gets cluttered)?
We can write functions for checking appropriate conditions and
supply the function to the list of validator functions in the call to
the ``FloatField`` constructor or other field constructors. The extra
code is a part of the ``model.py`` and the presented extensions appear
in the directory ``vib2_flask``.

The simplest approach to validation is to use existing functionality
in the web framework. Checking that :math:`A>0` can be done by
the ``NumberRange`` validator which checks that the value is inside
a prescribed interval:


.. code-block:: python

        from wtforms import Form, FloatField, validators
        
        class InputForm(Form):
            A = FloatField(
                label='amplitude (m)', default=1.0,
                validators=[validators.NumberRange(0, 1E+20)])


We can also easily provide our own more tailored validators.
As an example, let us explain how we can check that :math:`T` is less than 30 periods.
One period is :math:`2\pi /w` so we need to check if :math:`T> 30\cdot 2\pi/w`
and raise an exception in that case.
A validation function takes two arguments: the whole ``form`` and the
specific ``field`` to test:


.. code-block:: python

        def check_T(form, field):
            """Form validation: failure if T > 30 periods."""
            w = form.w.data
            T = field.data
            period = 2*pi/w
            if T > 30*period:
                num_periods = int(round(T/period))
                raise validators.ValidationError(
                    'Cannot plot as much as %d periods! T<%.2f' %
                    (num_periods, 30*period))

The appropriate exception is of type ``validators.ValidationError``.
Observe that through ``form`` we have in fact access to all the input
data so we can easily use the value of :math:`w` when checking the validity
of the value of :math:`T`. The ``check_T`` function is easy to
add to the list of validator functions in the call to the ``FloatField``
constructor for ``T``:


.. code-block:: python

        class InputForm(Form):
            ...
            T = FloatField(
                label='time interval', default=6*pi,
                validators=[validators.InputRequired(), check_T])

The validator
objects are tested one by one as the appear in the list, and if
one fails, the others are not invoked.
We therefore add ``check_T`` after the check of input such that we know we
have a value for all data when we run the computations and test
in ``check_T``.

Although there is already a ``NumberRange`` validator for checking
whether a value is inside an interval, we can write our own
version with some improved functionality for open intervals where
the maximum or minimum value can be infinite.
The infinite value can on input be represented by ``None``.
A general such function may take the form


.. code-block:: python

        def check_interval(form, field, min_value=None, max_value=None):
            """For validation: failure if value is outside an interval."""
            failure = False
            if min_value is not None:
                if field.data < min_value:
                    failure = True
            if max_value is not None:
                if field.data > max_value:
                    failure = True
            min_value = '-infty' if min_value is None else str(min_value)
            max_value =  'infty' if max_value is None else str(max_value)
            if failure:
                raise validators.ValidationError(
                    '%s=%s not in [%s, %s]' % (field.name, field.data,
                                               min_value, max_value))



.. index:: functools


The problem is that ``check_interval`` takes four arguments, not only
the ``form`` and ``field`` arguments that a validator function can accept.
The way out of this difficulty is to use a Python tool ``functools.partial``
which allows us to call a function with some of the arguments set.
Here, we want to create a new function that calls ``check_interval``
with some prescribed values of ``min_value`` and ``max_value``.
This function looks like it does not have these arguments, only
``form`` and ``field``. The following function produces this function:


.. code-block:: python

        import functools
        
        def interval(min_value=None, max_value=None):
            return functools.partial(
                check_interval, min_value=min_value, max_value=max_value)

We can in any field constructor just add
``interval(a, b)`` as a validator function checking if the field value is
in the interval between ``a`` and ``b``:


.. code-block:: python

        class InputForm(Form):
            ...
            b = FloatField(
                label='damping factor (kg/s)', default=0,
                validators=[validators.InputRequired(), interval(0,None)])


Let us test our tailored error checking. Run ``python controller.py``
in the ``vib2_flask`` directory and fill in :math:`-1.0` in the :math:`b` field.
Pressing *Compute* invokes our ``interval(0,None)`` function, which
is nothing but a call ``check_interval(field, form, 0, None)``,
and the test ``if field.data < min_value`` becomes true, ``failure``
is set and the exception is raised. The message in the exception
is available in the ``field.errors`` attribute so our template
will write it out in red, see Figure :ref:`wf:vib2:flask:fig:error1`.
The template used in ``vib_flask`` is basically the same as ``view3.html``
in ``vib1_flask``, i.e., it feaures LaTeX mathematics and checking of
``field.errors``.

   *Triggering of a user-defined error check*


Finally, we mention a detail in the ``view.py`` file in the ``vib2_flask``
app: instead of sending ``form.var.data`` to the ``compute`` function we
may automatically generate a set of local variables such that the
work with data from the web page looks nicer:


.. code-block:: python

        def index():
            form = InputForm(request.form)
            if request.method == 'POST' and form.validate():
                for field in form:
                    # Make local variable (name field.name)
                    exec('%s = %s' % (field.name, field.data))
                result = compute(A, b, w, T)
            else:
                result = None
        
            return render_template('view.html', form=form, result=result)

The idea is just to run ``exec`` on a declaration of a local variable
with name ``field.name`` for each field in the form. This trick is often
neat if data are buried in objects and you want variables in your
code to look like they do in mathematical writing.
