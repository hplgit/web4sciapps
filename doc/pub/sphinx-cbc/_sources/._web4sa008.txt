Handling multiple input variables in Flask
==========================================

The scientific hello world example shows how to work with one input
variable and one output variable. We can easily derive an extensible
recipe for apps with a collection of input variables and some
associated HTML code as result. Multiple input variables are listed
in the ``InputForm`` class using different types for different forms
(text field, float field, integer field, check box field for boolean
values, etc.).  The value of these variables will be available in a
``form`` object for computation. It is then a matter of setting
up a template code where the various variables if the ``form`` object
are formatted in HTML code as desired.

Our sample web application
addresses the task of plotting the function :math:`u(t)=Ae^{-bt}\sin (wt)` for
:math:`t\in [0,T]`. The web application must have fields for the numbers :math:`A`,
:math:`b`, :math:`w`, and :math:`T`, and a *Compute* button, as shown in Figure
:ref:`wf:vib1:flask:fig:input`. Filling in values, say :math:`0.1` for :math:`b` and
:math:`20` for :math:`T`, results in what we see in Figure :ref:`wf:vib1:flask:fig:result`,
i.e., a plot of :math:`u(t)` is added after the input fields and the *Compute*
button.

   *The input page*

.. _wf:vib1:flask:fig:result:

.. figure:: vib1_flask_output.png
   :width: 700

   *The result page*

We shall make a series of different versions of this app:

1. ``vib1`` for the basic set-up and illustration of tailoring the HTML code.

2. ``vib2`` for custom validation of input, governed by the programmer,
   and inlined graphics in the HTML code.

3. ``gen`` for automatic generation of the Flask app (!).

4. ``login`` for storing computed results in user accounts.

Programming the Flask application  (2)
--------------------------------------

The forthcoming text explains the necessary steps to realize a
Flask app that behaves as depicted in Figures :ref:`wf:vib1:flask:fig:input`
and :ref:`wf:vib1:flask:fig:result`. We start with the
``compute.py`` module since it contains only the computation of :math:`u(t)`
and the making of the plot, without any interaction with Flask.

The files associated with this app are found in the `vib1 <https://github.com/hplgit/web4sciapps/tree/master/doc/src/web4sa/src-web4sa/apps/flask_apps/vib1>`__ directory.

The compute part  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More specifically, inside ``compute.py``, we have a function for
evaluating :math:`u(t)` and a ``compute`` function for making the plot. The
return value of the latter is the name of the plot file, which should
get a unique name every time the ``compute`` function is called such
that the browser cannot reuse an already cached image when displaying
the plot. Flask
applications must have all extra files (CSS, images, etc.) in a
subdirectory ``static``.

.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import exp, cos, linspace
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import os, time, glob
        
        def damped_vibrations(t, A, b, w):
            return A*exp(-b*t)*cos(w*t)
        
        def compute(A, b, w, T, resolution=500):
            """Return filename of plot of the damped_vibration function."""
            t = linspace(0, T, resolution+1)
            y = damped_vibrations(t, A, b, w)
            plt.figure()  # needed to avoid adding curves in plot
            plt.plot(t, y)
            plt.title('A=%g, b=%g, w=%g' % (A, b, w))
            if not os.path.isdir('static'):
                os.mkdir('static')
            else:
                # Remove old plot files
                for filename in glob.glob(os.path.join('static', '*.png')):
                    os.remove(filename)
            # Use time since Jan 1, 1970 in filename in order make
            # a unique filename that the browser has not chached
            plotfile = os.path.join('static', str(time.time()) + '.png')
            plt.savefig(plotfile)
            return plotfile
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            print compute(1, 0.1, 1, 20)

   single: Flask; input forms


.. admonition:: Avoid file writing

   It is in general not a good idea to write plots to file or let a
   web app write to file. If this app is deployed at some web site and
   multiple users are running the app, the ``os.remove`` statements may remove
   plots created by all other users. However, the app is useful as a
   graphical user interface run locally on a machine.
   Later, we shall avoid writing plot files and instead
   store plots in strings and embed the strings
   in the ``img`` tag in the HTML code.




We organize the model, view, and controller as three separate
files, as illustrated in
the section :ref:`wf:hw3:flask`. This more complicated app involves
more code and especially the model will soon be handy to isolate in its own
file.

The model  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our first version of ``model.py`` reads

.. code-block:: python

        from wtforms import Form, FloatField, validators
        from math import pi
        
        class InputForm(Form):
            A = FloatField(
                label='amplitude (m)', default=1.0,
                validators=[validators.InputRequired()])
            b = FloatField(
                label='damping factor (kg/s)', default=0,
                validators=[validators.InputRequired()])
            w = FloatField(
                label='frequency (1/s)', default=2*pi,
                validators=[validators.InputRequired()])
            T = FloatField(
                label='time interval (s)', default=18,
                validators=[validators.InputRequired()])

As seen, the field classes can take a ``label`` argument for a longer
description, here also including the units in which the variable is
measured. It is also possible to add a ``description`` argument with
some help message. Furthermore, we include a ``default`` value, which
will appear in the text field such that the user does not need to
fill in all values.

.. index::
   single: Flask; index function

The view  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The view component will of course make use of templates, and we shall experiment
with different templates. Therefore, we allow a command-line argument
to this Flask app for choosing which template we want. The rest of
the ``controller.py`` file follows much the same set up as for the scientific
hello world app:

.. code-block:: python

        from model import InputForm
        from flask import Flask, render_template, request
        from compute import compute
        import sys
        
        try:
            template_name = sys.argv[1]
        except IndexError:
            template_name = 'view_plain'
        
        app = Flask(__name__)
        
        if template_name == 'view_flask_bootstrap':
            from flask_bootstrap import Bootstrap
            Bootstrap(app)
        
        @app.route('/vib1', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
        def index():
            form = InputForm(request.form)
            if request.method == 'POST' and form.validate():
                result = compute(form.A.data, form.b.data,
                                 form.w.data, form.T.data)
            else:
                result = None
        
            print 'XXX',result, request.method, [field.errors for field in form]
            return render_template(template_name + '.html',
                                   form=form, result=result)
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            app.run(debug=True)

The HTML template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The details governing how the web page really looks like lie in the
template file. Since we have several fields and want them nicely
align in a tabular fashion, we place the field name, text areas,
and labels inside an HTML table in our first attempt to write a
template, ``view_plain.html``:

.. code-block:: html

        <form method=post action="">
        <table>
          {% for field in form %}
            <tr>
            <td>{{ field.name }}</td><td>{{ field }}</td>
            <td>{{ field.label }}</td>
            </tr>
          {% endfor %}
        </table>
        <p><input type=submit value=Compute></form></p>
        
        <p>
        {% if result != None %}
        <img src="{{ result }}" width="500">
        {% endif %}
        </p>

Observe how easy it is to iterate over the ``form`` object and grab data
for each field: ``field.name`` is the name of the variable in the
``InputForm`` class, ``field.label`` is the full name with units as given
through the ``label`` keyword when constructing the field object, and
writing the field object itself generates the text area for
input (i.e., the HTML input form). The control statements we can
use in the template are part of the `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/>`__
templating language. For now, the if-test, for-loop and
output of values (``{{ object }}``) are enough to generate the HTML
code we want.

Recall that the objects we need in the template, like ``result`` and ``form``
in the present case, are transferred to the template via keyword
arguments to the ``render_template`` function. We can easily pass on
any object in our application to the template. Debugging of the template
is done by viewing the HTML source of the web page in the browser.

You are encouraged to go to the ``vib`` directory,
run ``python controller.py``, and load

.. code-block:: text

        `http://127.0.0.1:5000/vib1`

into your web browser for testing.
