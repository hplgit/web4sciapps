A very simple application
-------------------------

We shall start with the simplest possible application,
a "scientific hello world program", where the
task is to read a number and write out "Hello, World!" followed by
the sine of the number. This application has one input variable and
a line of text as output.

Our first implementation reads the input from the command
line and writes the results to the terminal window:

.. code-block:: python

        #!/usr/bin/env python
        import sys, math
        r = float(sys.argv[1])
        s = math.sin(r)
        print 'Hello, World! sin(%g)=%g' % (r, s)

In the terminal we can exemplify the program

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> python hw.py 1.2
        Hello, World! sin(1.2)=0.932039

The task of the web version of this program is to read the ``r``
variable from a web page, compute the sine,
and write out a new web page with the resulting text.
