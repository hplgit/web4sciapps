Programming the Django application  (1)
---------------------------------------

The Django application is about filling the files ``views.py`` and ``models.py``
with content. The mathematical computations are performed in ``compute.py``
so we copy this file from the ``mvc`` directory to the ``hw1`` directory
for convenience (we could alternatively add ``../mvc`` to ``sys.path`` such that
``import compute`` would work from the ``hw1`` directory).

The user interaction  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The web application offers a text field where the user can
write the value of ``r``, see Figure :ref:`wf:hw1:django:fig:input`.
After clicking on the *equals* button,
the mathematics is performed and a new page as
seen in Figure :ref:`wf:hw1:django:fig:result` appears.

.. index::
   single: Django; input forms

.. index::
   single: Django; models.py

The model  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``models.py`` file contains the model, which consists
of the data we need in the application, stored in Django's data types.
Our data consists of one number, called ``r``, and ``models.py`` then
look like

.. code-block:: python

        from django.db import models
        from django.forms import ModelForm
        
        class Input(models.Model):
            r = models.FloatField()
        
        class InputForm(ModelForm):
            class Meta:
                model = Input

The ``Input`` class lists variables representing data as static class
attributes. The ``django.db.models`` module contains various classes
for different types of data, here we use ``FloatField`` to represent
a floating-point number.
The ``InputForm`` class has a the shown generic form across applications
if we by convention apply the name ``Input`` for the class holding the data.

.. index::
   single: Django; index function

.. index::
   single: Django; views.py

The view  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``views.py`` file contains a function ``index`` which defines
the actions we want to perform when invoking
the URL ( here ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/hw1/``).
In addition, ``views.py`` has the ``present_output`` function from
the ``view.py`` file in the ``mvc`` directory.

.. code-block:: python

        from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
        from django.template import RequestContext
        from django.http import HttpResponse
        from models import InputForm
        from compute import compute
        
        def index(request):
            if request.method == 'POST':
                form = InputForm(request.POST)
                if form.is_valid():
                    form = form.save(commit=False)
                    return present_output(form)
            else:
                form = InputForm()
        
            return render_to_response('hw1.html',
                    {'form': form}, context_instance=RequestContext(request))
        
        def present_output(form):
            r = form.r
            s = compute(r)
            return HttpResponse('Hello, World! sin(%s)=%s' % (r, s))

The ``index`` function deserves some explanation. It must take one
argument, usually called ``request``. There are two modes in the function. Either
the user has provided input on the web page, which means that
``request.method`` equals ``'POST'``, or we show a new web page
with which the user is supposed to interact.

.. index::
   single: Django; HTML templates

Making the input page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The input consists of a web form with
one field where we can fill in our ``r`` variable. This page
is realized by the two central statements

.. code-block:: python

        # Make info needed in the web form
        form = InputForm()
        # Make HTML code
        render_to_response('hw1.html',
            {'form': form}, context_instance=RequestContext(request))

The ``hw1.html`` file resides in the ``templates`` subdirectory and contains
a template for the HTML code:

.. code-block:: html

        <form method="post" action="">{% csrf_token %}
            Hello, World! The sine of {{ form.r }}
            <input type="submit" value="equals" />
        </form>

This is a *template file* because it contains instructions like
``{% csrf_token %}`` and variables like ``{{ form.r }}``. Django will
replace the former by some appropriate HTML statements, while the
latter simply extracts the numerical value of the variable ``r`` in
our form (specified in the ``Input`` class in ``models.py``).
Typically, this ``hw1.html`` file
results in the HTML code

.. code-block:: html

        <form method="post" action="">
        <div style='display:none'>
        <input type='hidden' name='csrfmiddlewaretoken'
        value='oPWMuuy1gLlXm9GvUZINv49eVUYnux5Q' /></div>
            Hello, World! The sine of <input type="text" name="r" id="id_r" />
            <input type="submit" value="equals" />
        </form>

Making the results page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When then user has filled in a value in the text field on the input
page, the ``index`` function is called again and ``request.method`` equals
``'POST'``. A new form object is made, this time with user info (``request.POST``).
We can check that the form is valid and if so, proceed with
computations followed by presenting the results in a
new web page (see Figure :ref:`wf:hw1:django:fig:result`):

.. code-block:: python

        def index(request):
            if request.method == 'POST':
                form = InputForm(request.POST)
                if form.is_valid():
                    form = form.save(commit=False)
                    return present_output(form)
        
        def present_output(form):
            r = form.r
            s = compute(r)
            return HttpResponse('Hello, World! sin(%s)=%s' % (r, s))

The numerical value of ``r`` as given by the user is available as ``form.r``.
Instead of using a template for the output page, which is natural to
do in more advanced cases, we here illustrate the possibility to
send raw HTML to the output page by returning an ``HttpResponse``
object initialized by a string containing the desired HTML code.

Launch this application by filling in the address ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/hw1/``
in your web browser. Make sure the Django development server is running,
and if not, restart it by

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> python ../../../django_project/manage.py runserver

Fill
in some number on the input page and view the output.
To show how easy it is to change the application, invoke the ``views.py``
file in an editor and add some color to the output HTML code from
the ``present_output`` function:

.. code-block:: python

            return HttpResponse("""
        <font color='blue'>Hello</font>, World!
        sin(%s)=%s
        """% (r, s))

Go back to the input page, provide a new number, and observe how
the "Hello" word now has a blue color.

Equipping the input page with output results  (2)
-------------------------------------------------

Instead of making a separate output page with the result, we can
simply add the sine value to the input page. This makes the user
feel that she interacts with the same page, as when operating a calculator.
The output page should then look as shown in Figure :ref:`wf:hw2:django:fig:result`.

.. _wf:hw2:django:fig:result:

.. figure:: hw2_django_output.png
   :width: 600

   *The modified result page*

We need to make a new Django application, now called
`hw2 <https://github.com/hplgit/web4sciapps/tree/master/doc/src/web4sa/src-web4sa/apps/django_apps/hw2>`__.
Instead of running the standard
``manage.py startapp hw2`` command,
we can simply copy the ``hw1``
directory to ``hw2``. We need, of course, to add information about this
new application in ``settings.py`` and ``urls.py``.
In the former file we must have

.. code-block:: python

        TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
            relative2absolute_path('../../apps/django_apps/hw1/templates'),
            relative2absolute_path('../../apps/django_apps/hw2/templates'),
        )
        
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            'django.contrib.auth',
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            'django.contrib.sessions',
            'django.contrib.sites',
            'django.contrib.messages',
            'django.contrib.staticfiles',
            # Uncomment the next line to enable the admin:
            # 'django.contrib.admin',
            # Uncomment the next line to enable admin documentation:
            # 'django.contrib.admindocs',
            'hw1',
            'hw2',
        )

In ``urls.py`` we add the URL ``hw2`` which is to call our ``index`` function
in the ``views.py`` file of the ``hw2`` app:

.. code-block:: python

        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            url(r'^hw1/', 'django_apps.hw1.views.index'),
            url(r'^hw2/', 'django_apps.hw2.views.index'),

The ``views.py`` file changes a bit since we shall generate almost the same
web page on input and output. This makes the ``present_output`` function
unnatural, and everything is done within the ``index`` function:

.. code-block:: python

        def index(request):
            s = None  # initial value of result
            if request.method == 'POST':
                form = InputForm(request.POST)
                if form.is_valid():
                    form = form.save(commit=False)
                    r = form.r
                    s = compute(r)
            else:
                form = InputForm()
        
            return render_to_response('hw2.html',
                    {'form': form,
                     's': '%.5f' % s if isinstance(s, float) else ''
                     }, context_instance=RequestContext(request))

Note that the output variable ``s`` is computed within the ``index``
function and defaults to ``None``. The template file ``hw2.html``
looks like

.. code-block:: html

        <form method="post" action="">{% csrf_token %}
            Hello, World! The sine of {{ form.r }}
            <input type="submit" value="equals" />
        {% if s != '' %}
        {{ s }}
        {% endif %}
        </form>

The difference from ``hw1.html`` is that we right after the *equals*
button write out the value of ``s``. However, we make a test that
the value is only written if it is computed, here recognized by
being a non-empty string. The ``s`` in the template file
is substituted by the value of the object
corresponding to the key ``'s'`` in the
dictionary we pass to the ``render_to_response``. As seen,
we pass a string where ``s`` is formatted with five digits if ``s``
is a float, i.e., if ``s`` is computed. Otherwise, ``s`` has the
default value ``None`` and we send an empty string to the template.
The template language allows tests using Python syntax, but the
if-block must be explicitly ended by ``{% endif %}``.
