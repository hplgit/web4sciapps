Application of the MVC pattern
------------------------------



Before thinking of a web application, we first *refactor* our program
such that it fits with the classical MVC pattern and a compute component.
The refactoring does not change the functionality of the code, it
just distributes the original statements in functions and modules.
Here we create four modules: ``model``, ``view``,
``compute``, and ``controller``.

 * The ``compute`` module contains a function ``compute(r)`` that performs
   the mathematics and returns the value ``s``, which equals ``sin(r)``.

 * The ``model`` module holds the input data, here ``r``.

 * The ``view`` module has two functions, one for reading input data,
   ``get_input``,
   and one for presenting the output, ``present_output``.
   The latter takes the input, calls ``compute`` functionalty, and
   generates the output.

 * The ``controller`` module calls the view to initialize
   the model's data from the command line. Thereafter, the
   view is called to present the output.

The ``model.py`` file contains the ``r`` variable, which must
be declared with a default value in order to create the data object:


.. code-block:: python

        r = 0.0    # input
        s = None   # output


The ``view.py`` file is restricted to the communication with the user and reads


.. code-block:: python

        import sys
        import compute
        
        # Input: float r
        # Output: "Hello, World! sin(r)=..."
        
        def get_input():
            """Get input data from the command line."""
            r = float(sys.argv[1])
            return r
        
        def present_output(r):
            """Write results to terminal window."""
            s = compute.compute(r)
            print 'Hello, World! sin(%g)=%g' % (r, s)


The mathematics is encapsulated in ``compute.py``:


.. code-block:: python

        import math
        
        def compute(r):
            return math.sin(r)


Finally, ``controller.py`` glues the model and the view:


.. code-block:: python

        import model, view
        
        model.r = view.get_input()
        view.present_output(model.r)


Let us try our refactored code:


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python controller.py 1.2
        Hello, World! sin(1.2)=0.932039


The next step is to create a web interface to our scientific hello world
program such that we can fill in the number ``r`` in a text field, click a
*Compute* button and get back a new web page with the output text
shown above: "Hello, World! sin(r)=s".
