======= Making a Flask application =======

idx{Flask!installation}

Not much code or configuration is needed to make a Flask application.
Actually one short file is enough. For this file to work you need to
install Flask and some corresponding packages. This is easiest
performed by

!bc sys
Terminal> sudo pip install --upgrade Flask
Terminal> sudo pip install --upgrade Flask-WTF
!ec
The `--upgrade` option ensures that you upgrade to the latest version in
case you already have these packages.

===== Programming the Flask application =====

__The user interaction.__
We want our input page to feature a text field where the user can
write the value of `r`, see Figure ref{wf:hw1:flask:fig:input}.
By clicking on the *equals* button
the corresponding `s` value is computed and written out the result page
seen in Figure ref{wf:hw1:flask:fig:result}.

<%
app_path = src_path + 'flask_apps/hw1'
%>

__The Python code.__
Flask does not require us to use the MVC pattern so there is actually
no need to split the original program into model, view, controller,
and compute files as already explained (but it will be
done later).  First we make a `controller.py` file where the view, the
model, and the controller parts appear within the same file.
The `compute` component is always in a separate file as
we like to encapsulate the computations completely from user
interfaces.

idx{Flask!input forms}

The view that the user sees is determined by
HTML templates in a subdirectory `templates`, and consequently
we name the template files `view*.html`.
The model and other parts of the view concept are just parts of
the `controller.py` file. The complete file is short and explained
in detail below.

@@@CODE ${app_path}/controller.py

__Dissection.__
The web application is the `app` object of class `Flask`, and initialized
as shown. The model is a special Flask class derived from `Form`
where the input variable in the app is listed as a
static class attribute and initialized
by a special form field object from the `wtforms` package.
Such form field objects correspond to HTML forms in the input page.
For the `r` variable we apply `FloatField` since it is a floating-point
variable. A default validator, here checking that the user supplies
a real number, is automatically included, but we add another validator,
`InputRequired`, to force the user to provide input before clicking on
the *equals* button.

The view part of this Python code consists of
a URL and a corresponding function to call when the URL is invoked.
The function name is here chosen to be `index` (inspired by the standard
`index.html` page that is the main page of a web app). The
decorator `@app.route('/hw1', ...)` maps the URL
`http://127.0.0.1:5000/hw1` to a call to `index`.
The `methods` argument must be as shown to allow the user to communicate
with the web page.

idx{Flask!`index` function}

The `index` function first makes a form object based on the data in
the model, here class `InputForm`. Then there are two possibilities:
either the user has provided data in the HTML form or the user is
to be offered an input form. In the former case, `request.method`
equals `'POST'` and we can extract the numerical value of `r`
from the `form` object, using `form.r.data`, call up our mathematical
computations, and make a web page with the result.
In the latter case, we make an input page as displayed in
Figure ref{wf:hw1:flask:fig:input}.

idx{Flask!HTML templates}

__The template files.__
Making a web page with Flask is conveniently done by an HTML
template. Since the output page is simplest we display the
`view_output.html` template first:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/templates/view_output.html

Keyword arguments sent to `render_template` are available in the
HTML template. Here we have `form` and `s`.
With the `form` object we extract the value of
`r` in the HTML code by `{{ form.r.data }}`. Similarly, the value of `s`
is simply `{{ s }}`.

The HTML template for the input page is slightly more complicated
as we need to use an HTML form:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/templates/view_input.html


__Testing the application.__
We collect the files associated with a Flask application (often called
just *app*) in a directory,
here called "`hw1`": "${github_path}/${app_path}".
All you have to do in order to run this web application is to find
this directory and run

!bc sys
Terminal> python controller.py
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
 * Restarting with reloader
!ec
Open a new window or tab in your browser and type in the URL
`http://127.0.0.1:5000/hw1`.

===== Equipping the input page with output results =====

## Define Mako variable for path to source code
<%
app_path = src_path + 'flask_apps/hw2'
%>

Our application made two distinct pages for grabbing input from the
user and presenting the result. It is often more natural to add
the result to the input page. This is particularly the case in the present
web application, which is a kind of calculator. Figure ref{wf:hw2:flask:fig:result} shows what the user sees after clicking the *equals* button.

FIGURE: [fig-web4sa/hw2_flask_output, width=600] The modified result page. label{wf:hw2:flask:fig:result}

To let the user stay within the same page, we create a new directory
"`hw2`": "${github_path}/${app_path}"
for this modified Flask app and copy the files from the previous
`hw1` directory.  The idea now is to make use of just one
template, in `templates/view.html`:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/templates/view.html

The form is identical to what we used in `view_input.html` in
the `hw1` directory, and the only
new thing is the output of `s` below the form.

The template language supports some programming with Python objects
inside `{%` and `%}` tags.
Specifically in this file, we can test on the value of `s`:
if it is `None`, we know that the computations are not performed and
`s` should not appear on the page, otherwise `s` holds the sine
value and we can write it out. Note that, contrary to plain Python,
the template language does not rely on indentation of blocks and
therefore needs an explicit end statement `{% endif %}` to finish
the if-test.
The generated HTML code from this template file reads

!bc htmlpro
<form method=post action="">
  Hello, World! The sine of
  <input id="r" name="r" type="text" value="1.2">
  <input type=submit value=equals>

0.932039085967

</form>
!ec

The `index` function of our modified application
needs adjustments since we use the same
template for the input and the output page:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/controller.py fromto: # View@if __name
It is seen that if the user has given data, `s` is a `float`, otherwise
`s` is `None`. You are encouraged to test the app by running

!bc sys
Terminal> python controller.py
!ec
and loading `http://127.0.0.1:5000/hw2` into your browser.
A nice little exercise is to control the formatting of the result `s`.
To this end, you can simply transform `s` to a string: `s = '%.5f' % s` before
sending it to `render_template`.

===== Splitting the app into model, view, and controller files =====
label{wf:hw3:flask}

## Define Mako variable for path to source code
<%
app_path = src_path + 'flask_apps/hw3'
%>

idx{Flask!MVC pattern}

In our previous two Flask apps we have had the view displayed for the
user in a separate template file, and the computations as always in
`compute.py`, but everything else was placed in one file `controller.py`.
For illustration of the MVC concept we
may split the `controller.py` into two files: `model.py` and
`controller.py`. The view is in `templates/view.html`.
These new files are located in a
directory
"`hw3_flask`": "${github_path}/${app_path}"
The contents
in the files reflect the splitting introduced in the original
scientific hello world program in Section ref{wf:hw:mvc}.
The `model.py` file now consists of the input form class:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/model.py
The file `templates/view.html` is as before, while `controller.py` contains

@@@CODE ${app_path}/controller.py

The statements are indentical to those in the `hw2` app, only
the organization of the statement in files differ.

===== Troubleshooting =====

idx{Flask!troubleshooting}

__Address already in use.__
You can easily kill the Flask application and restart it, but sometimes
you will get an error that the address is already in use.
To recover from this problem, run the `lsof` program to see which program
that applies the 5000 port (Flask runs its server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`,
which means that it uses the 5000 port). Find the PID of the program
that occupies the port and force abortion of that program:

!bc sys
Terminal> lsof -i :5000
COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE  DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
python  48824  hpl    3u  IPv4 1128848      0t0  TCP ...
Terminal> kill -9 48824
!ec
You are now ready to restart a Flask application.
