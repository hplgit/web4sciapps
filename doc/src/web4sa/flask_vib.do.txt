======= Handling multiple input variables in Flask =======
label{wf:vib:flask}

The scientific hello world example shows how to work with one input
variable and one output variable. We can easily derive an extensible
recipe for apps with a collection of input variables and some
associated HTML code as result. Multiple input variables are listed
in the `InputForm` class using different types for different forms
(text field, float field, integer field, check box field for boolean
values, etc.).  The value of these variables will be available in a
`form` object for computation. It is then a matter of setting
up a template code where the various variables if the `form` object
are formatted in HTML code as desired.

Our sample web application
addresses the task of plotting the function $u(t)=Ae^{-bt}\sin (wt)$ for
$t\in [0,T]$. The web application must have fields for the numbers $A$,
$b$, $w$, and $T$, and a *Compute* button, as shown in Figure
ref{wf:vib1:flask:fig:input}. Filling in values, say $0.1$ for $b$ and
$20$ for $T$, results in what we see in Figure ref{wf:vib1:flask:fig:result},
i.e., a plot of $u(t)$ is added after the input fields and the *Compute*
button.

FIGURE: [fig-web4sa/vib1_flask_output, width=700] The result page. label{wf:vib1:flask:fig:result}

We shall make a series of different versions of this app:

 * `vib1` for the basic set-up and illustration of tailoring the HTML code.
 * `vib2` for custom validation of input, governed by the programmer,
   and inlined graphics in the HTML code.
 * `vib3` for automatic generation of the Flask app (!).
 * `vib4` for storing computed results in user accounts.

===== Programming the Flask application =====
label{wf:vib1:flask:app}

## Define Mako variable for path to source code
<%
app_path = src_path + 'flask_apps/vib1'
%>

The forthcoming text explains the necessary steps to realize a
Flask app that behaves as depicted in Figures ref{wf:vib1:flask:fig:input}
and ref{wf:vib1:flask:fig:result}. We start with the
`compute.py` module since it contains only the computation of $u(t)$
and the making of the plot, without any interaction with Flask.

The files associated with this app are found in the "`vib1`":
"${github_path}/${app_path}" directory.

__The compute part.__
More specifically, inside `compute.py`, we have a function for
evaluating $u(t)$ and a `compute` function for making the plot. The
return value of the latter is the name of the plot file, which should
get a unique name every time the `compute` function is called such
that the browser cannot reuse an already cached image when displaying
the plot. Flask
applications must have all extra files (CSS, images, etc.) in a
subdirectory `static`.

@@@CODE ${app_path}/compute.py

idx{Flask!input forms}

!bwarning Avoid file writing
It is in general not a good idea to write plots to file or let a
web app write to file. If this app is deployed at some web site and
multiple users are running the app, the `os.remove` statements may remove
plots created by all other users. However, the app is useful as a
graphical user interface run locally on a machine.
Later, we shall avoid writing plot files and instead
store plots in strings and embed the strings
in the `img` tag in the HTML code.
!ewarning

We organize the model, view, and controller as three separate
files, as illustrated in
Section ref{wf:hw3:flask}. This more complicated app involves
more code and especially the model will soon be handy to isolate in its own
file.

__The model.__ Our first version of `model.py` reads

@@@CODE ${app_path}/model.py

As seen, the field classes can take a `label` argument for a longer
description, here also including the units in which the variable is
measured. It is also possible to add a `description` argument with
some help message. Furthermore, we include a `default` value, which
will appear in the text field such that the user does not need to
fill in all values.

idx{Flask!`index` function}


__The view.__
The view component will of course make use of templates, and we shall experiment
with different templates. Therefore, we allow a command-line argument
to this Flask app for choosing which template we want. The rest of
the `controller.py` file follows much the same set up as for the scientific
hello world app:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/controller.py

__The HTML template.__
The details governing how the web page really looks like lie in the
template file. Since we have several fields and want them nicely
align in a tabular fashion, we place the field name, text areas,
and labels inside an HTML table in our first attempt to write a
template, `view_plain.html`:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/templates/view_plain.html
Observe how easy it is to iterate over the `form` object and grab data
for each field: `field.name` is the name of the variable in the
`InputForm` class, `field.label` is the full name with units as given
through the `label` keyword when constructing the field object, and
writing the field object itself generates the text area for
input (i.e., the HTML input form). The control statements we can
use in the template are part of the "Jinja2": "http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/"
templating language. For now, the if-test, for-loop and
output of values (`{{ object }}`) are enough to generate the HTML
code we want.

Recall that the objects we need in the template, like `result` and `form`
in the present case, are transferred to the template via keyword
arguments to the `render_template` function. We can easily pass on
any object in our application to the template. Debugging of the template
is done by viewing the HTML source of the web page in the browser.

You are encouraged to go to the `vib` directory,
run `python controller.py`, and load

!bc
`http://127.0.0.1:5000/vib1`
!ec
into your web browser for testing.

!split
===== Implementing error checking in the template =====

idx{Flask!error checking}

What happens if the user gives wrong input, for instance the letters `asd`
instead of a number? Actually nothing! The `FloatField` object
checks that the input is compatible with a real number in the
`form.validate()` call, but returns just `False` if this is not
the case. Looking at the code in `controller.py`,

!bc pycod
def index():
    form = InputForm(request.form)
    if request.method == 'POST' and form.validate():
        result = compute(form.A.data, form.b.data,
                         form.w.data, form.T.data)
    else:
        result = None
!ec
we realize that wrong input implies `result = None` and no computations
and no plot! Fortunately, each field object gets an attribute `error`
with information on errors that occur on input. We can write out
this information on the web page, as exemplified in the template
`view_errcheck.html`:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/templates/view_errcheck.html
Two things are worth noticing here:

 o We can control the width of the text field where the
   user writes the numbers, here set to 12 characters.
 o We can make an extra column in the HTML table with a list
   of possible errors for each field object.

Let us test the error handling of the `A` field by
writing `asd` instead of a number. This input
triggers an error, whose message is written in red to the right of the label,
see Figure ref{wf:vib1:flask:fig:error1}.

FIGURE: [fig-web4sa/vib1_flask_error1, width=500] Error message because of wrong input. label{wf:vib1:flask:fig:error1}

It is possible to use the additional HTML5 fields for input in a Flask
context. Instead of explaining how here, we recommend to use the
"Parampool": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool"
package to automatically generate Flask files with HTML5 fields.

!split
===== Using style sheets =====

idx{Flask!CSS style sheets}

Web developers make heavy use of CSS style sheets to control the look
and feel of web pages. Templates can utilize style sheets as any other
standard HTML code. Here is a very simple example where we introduce
a class `name` for the HTML table's column with the field name and set the
foreground color of the text in this column to blue.
The style sheet is called `basic.css` and *must* reside in the
`static` subdirectory of the Flask application directory. The content
of `basic.css` is just the line

@@@CODE ${app_path}/static/basic.css
The `view_css.html` file using this style sheet features a `link` tag
to the style sheet in the HTML header, and the column containing
the field name has
the HTML tag `<td class="name">` to trigger the specification in
the style sheet:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/templates/view_css.html fromto: @\{% if field\.errors
Just run `python controller.py view_css` to see that the names
of the variables to set in the web page are blue.

===== Using LaTeX mathematics =====

idx{Flask!LaTeX mathematics}

Scientific applications frequently have many input data that are
defined through mathematics and where the typesetting on the
web page should be as close as possible to the typesetting where
the mathematics is documented. In the present example we would like
to typeset $A$, $b$, $w$, and $T$ with italic font as done
in LaTeX. Fortunately, native LaTeX typesetting is available in
HTML through the tool "MathJax": "http://www.mathjax.org/".
Our template `view_tex.html` enables MathJax. Formulas are written
with standard LaTeX inside `\(` and `\)`, while equations are surrounded
by `$$`. Here we use formulas only:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/templates/view_tex.html fromto: @\{% if field\.errors
Figure ref{wf:vib1:flask:fig:latex} displays how the
LaTeX rendering looks like in the browser.

FIGURE: [fig-web4sa/vib1_flask_latex, width=650] LaTeX typesetting of mathematical symbols. label{wf:vib1:flask:fig:latex}


===== Rearranging the elements in the HTML template =====

Now we want to place the plot to the right of the input forms in
the web page, see Figure ref{wf:vib1:flask:fig:sidebyside}. This can
be accomplished by having an outer table with two rows. The first
row contains the table with the input forms in the first column and
the plot in the second column, while the second row features the
*Compute* button in the first column.

FIGURE: [fig-web4sa/vib1_flask_table2, width=700] New design with input and output side by side. label{wf:vib1:flask:fig:sidebyside}

The enabling template file is `view_table.html`:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/templates/view_table.html

!split
===== Bootstrap HTML style =====

The "Bootstrap": "http://getbootstrap.com/" framework for creating web pages
has been very popular in recent years, both because of the design and
the automatic support for responsive pages on all sorts of devices.
Bootstrap can be used in combination with Flask. The template file
`view_bootstrap.html` is identical to the former `view_table.html`,
except that we load the Bootstrap CSS file and include in comments
how to add the typical navigation bar found in many Bootstrap-based
web pages. The template looks like

@@@CODE ${app_path}/templates/view_bootstrap.html
The input fields and fonts now get the typical Bootstrap look and feel.
The only special feature in this template is the need to pass a CSS
class `form-control` to the field object in the part that defines
the input field. We also use the standard `input-group-addon` style
in the name part of the Bootstrap form. A heading *Damped sine wave* was
added to demonstrate the Bootstrap fonts.

It is easy to switch to other Bootstrap styles, e.g., those in the
"Bootswatch family": "http:bootswatch.com":

!bc htmlcod
<link href=
"http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/3.1.1/X/bootstrap.min.css"
rel="stylesheet">
!ec
where `X` can be `cerulean`, `cosmo`, `flatly`, and other legal
Bootswatch styles.

test
MAKE FIGS

While `view_bootstrap.html` makes use of plain Bootstrap HTML code, there is
also a higher-level framework, called "Flask-Bootstrap": "http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/" that combines Flask and Bootstrap. Installation of
this extension is done by `sudo pip install flask-bootstrap`.

After `app = Flask(__name__)` we need to do

!bc pycod
from flask_bootstrap import Bootstrap
Bootstrap(app)
!ec

The template employs new keywords `extends` and `block`:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/templates/view_flask_bootstrap.html
It is important to have the MathJax script declaration and all styles within
`{% block styles %}`.
Other basic templates than `base.html` can be used:
`fixes.html`, `google.html`, and `wtf.html`.

!split
===== Custom validation =====
label{wf:vib1:flask:validation}

## Define Mako variable for path to source code
<%
app_path = src_path + 'flask_apps/vib2'
%>

idx{Flask!input validation}


The `FloatField` objects can check that the input is compatible with
a number, but what if we want to control that $A>0$, $b>0$, and
$T$ is not greater than 30 periods (otherwise the plot gets cluttered)?
We can write functions for checking appropriate conditions and
supply the function to the list of validator functions in the call to
the `FloatField` constructor or other field constructors. The extra
code is a part of the `model.py` and the presented extensions appear
in the directory "`vib2`": "${github_path}/${app_path}".

=== Using Flask validators ===

The simplest approach to validation is to use existing functionality
in the web framework. Checking that $A>0$ can be done by
the `NumberRange` validator which checks that the value is inside
a prescribed interval:

!bc pycod
from wtforms import Form, FloatField, validators

class InputForm(Form):
    A = FloatField(
        label='amplitude (m)', default=1.0,
        validators=[validators.NumberRange(0, 1E+20)])
!ec

=== Tailored validation ===

We can also easily provide our own more tailored validators.
As an example, let us explain how we can check that $T$ is less than 30 periods.
One period is $2\pi /w$ so we need to check if $T> 30\cdot 2\pi/w$
and raise an exception in that case.
A validation function takes two arguments: the whole `form` and the
specific `field` to test:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/model.py fromto: def check_T@def check_interval
The appropriate exception is of type `validators.ValidationError`.
Observe that through `form` we have in fact access to all the input
data so we can easily use the value of $w$ when checking the validity
of the value of $T$. The `check_T` function is easy to
add to the list of validator functions in the call to the `FloatField`
constructor for `T`:

!bc pycod
class InputForm(Form):
    ...
    T = FloatField(
        label='time interval', default=6*pi,
        validators=[validators.InputRequired(), check_T])
!ec
The validator
objects are tested one by one as they appear in the list, and if
one fails, the others are not invoked.
We therefore add `check_T` after the check of input such that we know we
have a value for all data when we run the computations and test
in `check_T`.

=== Tailored validation of intervals ===

Although there is already a `NumberRange` validator for checking
whether a value is inside an interval, we can write our own
version with some improved functionality for open intervals where
the maximum or minimum value can be infinite.
The infinite value can on input be represented by `None`.
A general such function may take the form

@@@CODE ${app_path}/model.py fromto: def check_interval@def interval

idx{`functools`}

The problem is that `check_interval` takes four arguments, not only
the `form` and `field` arguments that a validator function in the
Flask framework can accept.
The way out of this difficulty is to use a Python tool `functools.partial`
which allows us to call a function with some of the arguments set beforehand.
Here, we want to create a new function that calls `check_interval`
with some prescribed values of `min_value` and `max_value`.
This function looks like it does not have these arguments, only
`form` and `field`. The following function produces this function, which we
can use as a valid Flask validator function:

!bc pycod
import functools

def interval(min_value=None, max_value=None):
    return functools.partial(
        check_interval, min_value=min_value, max_value=max_value)
!ec
We can now in any field constructor just add
`interval(a, b)` as a validator function, here checking that $b\in [0,\infty)$:

!bc pycod
class InputForm(Form):
    ...
    b = FloatField(
        label='damping factor (kg/s)', default=0,
        validators=[validators.InputRequired(), interval(0,None)])
!ec

=== Demo ===

Let us test our tailored error checking. Run `python controller.py`
in the `vib2` directory and fill in $-1.0$ in the $b$ field.
Pressing *Compute* invokes our `interval(0,None)` function, which
is nothing but a call to `check_interval` with the
arguments `field`, `form`, `0`, and `None`.
Inside this function,
the test `if field.data < min_value` becomes true, `failure`
is set, and the exception is raised. The message in the exception
is available in the `field.errors` attribute so our template
will write it out in red, see Figure ref{wf:vib2:flask:fig:error1}.
The template used in `vib2` is basically the same as `view_tex.html`
in `vib1`, i.e., it feaures LaTeX mathematics and checking of
`field.errors`.

FIGURE: [fig-web4sa/vib2_flask_error1, width=500] Triggering of a user-defined error check. label{wf:vib2:flask:fig:error1}

Finally, we mention a detail in the `controller.py` file in the `vib2`
app: instead of sending `form.var.data` to the `compute` function we
may automatically generate a set of local variables such that the
application of data from the web page, here in the `compute` call, looks nicer:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/controller.py fromto: def index@
The idea is just to run `exec` on a declaration of a local variable
with name `field.name` for each field in the form. This trick is often
neat if web variables are buried in objects (`form.T.data`) and you want these
variables in your
code to look like they do in mathematical writing (`T` for $T$).


!split
===== Avoiding plot files =====
label{wf:vib3:flask:nofiles}

Files with plots are easy to deal with as long as they are in the
`static` subdirectory of the Flask application directory. However,
as already pointed out, the previous `vib1` app, which writes plot
files, is not suited for multiple simultaneous users since every
user will destroy *all* existing plot files before making a new
one. Therefore, we need a robust solution for multiple users of
the app.

The idea is to not write plot files, but instead return the plot
as a string and embed that string directly in the HTML code.
This is relatively straightforward with Matplotlib
and Python. The relevant code is found in the `compute.py` file
of the `vib2` app.

idx{inline PNG image in HTML}
idx{`StringIO` objects}
idx{file-like string objects (`StringIO`)}
idx{strings as files (`StringIO`)}
idx{base64 encoding of PNG images}

=== PNG plots ===

Python has the `StringIO` object that is a string buffer with the
look and behavior of a file. The idea is to let Matplotlib write to
a `StringIO` object and afterwards extract the string from this object:

!bc pycod
import matplotlib.pyplot as plot
from StringIO import StringIO
# run plt.plot, plt.title, etc.
figfile = StringIO()
plt.savefig(figfile, format='png')
figfile.seek(0)  # rewind to beginning of file
figdata_png = figfile.buf  # extract string
!ec
Before the PNG data can be embedded in HTML we need to convert the
data to base64 format:

!bc pycod
import base64
figdata_png = base64.b64encode(figdata_png)
!ec
Now we can embed the PNG data in HTML by

!bc pycod
<img src="data:image/png;base64,PLOTSTR" width="500">
!ec
where `PLOTSTR` is the content of the string `figdata_png`.

The complete `compute.py` function takes the form

@@@CODE ${app_path}/compute.py fromto: def compute\(@def compute_png

The relevant syntax in an HTML template is

!bc htmlcod
<img src="data:image/png;base64,{{ results }}" width="500">
!ec
if `results` holds the returned object from the `compute` function above.

idx{inline SVG figure in HTML}

=== SVG plots ===

Inline figures in HTML, instead of using files, are most often realized
by XML code with the figure data in SVG format.
Plot strings in the SVG format are created very similarly to the PNG
example:

!bc pycod
figfile = StringIO()
plt.savefig(figfile, format='svg')
figdata_svg = figfile.buf
!ec
The `figdata_svg` string contains XML code text can almost
be directly embedded in
HTML5. However, the beginning of the text contains information before
the `svg` tag that we want to remove:

!bc dat
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
<!-- Created with matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) -->
<svg height="441pt" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 585 441" ...
!ec
The removal is done with a little string manipulation:

!bc pycod
figdata_svg = '<svg' + figfile.buf.split('<svg')[1]
!ec
Now, `figdata_svg` can be directly inserted in HTML code without
any surrounding tags (because it is perfectly valid HTML code in itself).

The SVG code generated by Matplotlib may contain UTF-8 characters
so it is necessary to make a unicode string out of the text:
`unicode(figdata_svg, 'utf-8')`, otherwise the HTML template will
lead to an encoding exception.

We have made an alternative compute function `compute_png_svg`
that returns both a PNG and an SVG plot:

!bc pycod
def compute_png_svg(A, b, w, T, resolution=500):
    ...
    figfile = StringIO()
    plt.savefig(figfile, format='svg')
    figfile.seek(0)
    figdata_svg = '<svg' + figfile.buf.split('<svg')[1]
    figdata_svg = unicode(figdata_svg,'utf-8')
    return figdata_png, figdata_svg
!ec

idx{`safe`, as in `object|safe`}

The relevant syntax for inserting an SVG plot in the HTML template is now

!bc htmlcod
{{ result[1]|safe }}
!ec
The use of `safe` is essential here.

!bnotice Important: use `safe` for verbatim HTML code:
Special HTML characters like `<`, `>`,
`&`, `"`, and `'` are escaped in a template string like `{{ str }}`
(i.e., `&` is replaced by `&amp;` `<` is replaced by `&lt;`, etc.).
We need to avoid this manipulation of the string content
because `result[1]` contains
XML code where the mentioned characters are essential part of the syntax.
Writing `{{str|safe}}` ensures that the contents of the string `str`
are not altered before being embedded in the HTML text.
!enotice

An alternative template, `view_svg.html` applies the SVG plot instead
of the PNG plot. We use the command-line argument `svg` for indicating
that we want an SVG instead of a PNG plot:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/controller.py fromto: # SVG@app = Flask

===== Autogenerating the code =====
label{wf:vib3:flask:autogen}

## Define Mako variable for path to source code
<%
app_path = src_path + 'flask_apps/vib3'
%>

idx{`getattr`} idx{`setattr`} idx{`hasattr`}

We shall now present generic `model.py` and `controller.py`
files that work with *any* `compute` function (!). This example will
demonstrate some advanced, powerful features of Python. The source code
is found in the "`vib3`": "${github_path}/${app_path}"
directory.

__Inspecting function signatures.__
The basic idea is that the Python module `inspect` can be used to
retrieve the names of the arguments and the default values of
keyword arguments of *any* given `compute` function. Say we have some

!bc pycod
def mycompute(A, m=0, s=1, w=1, x_range=[-3,3]):
    ...
    return result
!ec
Running

!bc pycod
import inspect
arg_names = inspect.getargspec(mycompute).args
defaults  = inspect.getargspec(mycompute).defaults
!ec
leads to

!bc pycod
arg_names = ['A', 'm', 's', 'w', 'x_range']
defaults = (0, 1, 1, [-3, 3])
!ec
We have all the argument names in `arg_names` and
`defaults[i]` is the default value of keyword argument
`arg_names[j]`, where `j = len(arg_names) - len(defaults) + i`.

__Generating the model.__
Knowing the name `name` of some argument in the `compute`
function, we can make the corresponding class attribute
in the `InputForm` class by

!bc pycod
setattr(InputForm, name, FloatForm())
!ec
For name equal to `'A'` this is the same as hardcoding

!bc pycod
class InputForm:
    A = FloatForm()
!ec
Assuming that all arguments in `compute` are floats, we could
do

!bc pycod
class InputForm:
    pass  # Empty class

arg_names = inspect.getargspec(mycompute).args
for name in arg_names:
    setattr(InputForm, name, FloatForm())
!ec
However, we can do better than this: for
keyword arguments the type of the default value can be used to
select the appropriate form class. The complete `model.py` file
then goes as follows:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/model.py
(The `compute_gamma` function imported from `compute` is the
only application-specific statement in this code and will be explained later.)

__Generating the view.__
The call to `compute` in the `controller.py` file must also be expressed
in a general way such that the call handles any type and number of
parameters. This can be done in two ways, using either positional
or keyword arguments.

The technique with positional arguments
is explained first. It consists of collecting all parameters in
a list or tuple, called `args`, and then calling `compute(*args)`
(which is equivalent to `compute(args[0], args[1], ..., args[n])`
if `n` is `len(args)-1`). The elements of `args` are the values of the
form variables. We know the name of a form variable as a string
`name` (from `arg_names`), and if `form` is the form object,
the construction `getattr(form, name).data` extracts the value
that the user provided (`getattr(obj, attr)` gets the attribute, with name
available as a string in `attr`, in the object `obj`).
For exampe, if `name` is `'A'`, `getattr(form, name).data` is the same as
`form.A.data`.
Collecting all form variables, placing them in a list,
and calling `compute` are done with

!bc pycod
arg_names = inspect.getargspec(compute).args
args = [getattr(form, name).data for name in arg_names]
result = compute(*args)
!ec
Our `InputForm` class guarantees that all arguments in `compute`
are present in the form, but to be absolutely safe we can
test if `name` is present in the `form` object:

!bc pycod
args = [getattr(form, name).data for name in arg_names
        if hasattr(form, name)]
!ec

A potential problem with the `args` list is that the values might
be in wrong order. It appears, fortunately, that the order we
assign attributes to the form class is preserved when iterating over
the form. Nevertheless, using keyword arguments instead of positional
arguments provides a completely safe solution to calling `compute`
with the correct arguments. Keyword arguments are placed in a
dictionary `kwargs` and `compute` is called as `compute(**kwargs)`.
The generic solution is

!bc pycod
kwargs = {name: getattr(form, name).data for name in arg_names
          if hasattr(form, name)}
result = compute(**kwargs)
!ec
The `compute(**kwargs)` call is equivalent to `compute(A=1, b=3, w=0.5)`
in case `kwargs = {'w'=0.5, 'A':1, 'b':3}` (recall that the order of
the keys in a Python dictionary is undetermined).

__Generating the template.__
It remains to generate the right HTML template. The HTML code depends
on what the returned `result` object from `compute` contains. Only a
human who has read the `compute` code knows the details of the returned
result. Therefore, we leave it to a human to provide the part
of the HTML template that renders the result. The file `templates/view_results.html` contains this human-provided code, while `templates/view.html`
is a completely generic template for the forms:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/templates/view.html
At the end of this code, an HTML text `result` (string) is to be
inserted.  This text is typically generated by calling Flask's
`render_template` function, which uses `templates/view_results.html`
to turn the return object `result` from the compute function into the
desired HTML code:

!bc pycod
def index():
    ...
    if result:
        result = render_template('view_results.html', result=result)
        # result is now rendered HTML text
    return render_template('view.html', form=form, result=result)
!ec

!bnotice
A perhaps simpler alternative would be to have a generic
`view_forms.html` file and a user-specific
`view_results.html` and explicitly combining them into a new
file. This requires file writing by the app, which one normally
wants to avoid. Especially if the web app gets multiple users,
the file writing may lead to corrupt files.

The complete, generic form of the `index` function becomes

@@@CODE ${app_path}/controller.py fromto: def index@

__Application.__
Let us apply the files above to plot the gamma probability density function

!bt
\[ g(x; a, h, A) = \frac{|h|}{\Gamma(a)A}\left(\frac{x}{A}\right)^{ah-1}
e^{-\left(\frac{x}{A}\right)^h},
\]
!et
and its cumulative density

!bt
\[ G(x; a, h, A) = \int_0^x g(\tau; a, h, A)d\tau,\]
!et
computed by numerically the Trapezoidal rule, for instance.
We also want to compute and display
the mean value $A\Gamma(a + 1/h)/\Gamma(a)$ and
standard deviation

!bt
\[ \sigma = \frac{A}{\Gamma(a)}\sqrt{\Gamma(a + 2/h)\Gamma(a) - \Gamma(a+1/h)^2}.\]
!et
Here, $\Gamma(a)$ is the gamma function, which can be computed
by `math.gamma(a)` in Python.
Below is a `compute.py` file with the
relevant implementations of $g(x;a,h,A)$ (`gamma_density`),
$G(x; a, h, A)$ (`gamma_cumulative`), and a function `compute_gamma` for
making a plot of $g$ og $G$ for $x\in [0,7\sigma]$.

@@@CODE ${app_path}/compute.py fromto: def gamma_density@
The `compute_gamma` function returns a tuple of six values.
We want output as displayed in Figure ref{wf:vib3:flask:fig:gamma}.

FIGURE: [fig-web4sa/vib3_flask_gamma, width=700] Design of a web page illustrating the gamma probability functions. label{wf:vib3:flask:fig:gamma}

The design is realized in the file `view_results.html` shown below.

@@@CODE ${app_path}/templates/view_results.html

To create the web application, we just perform the following steps:

 o copy the generic `controller.py` and `model.py` files to a new directory
 o write the compute function in a file `compute.py`
 o edit `controller.py` and `model.py` to use the right name of the
   compute function (`from compute import name as compute`)
 o add an appropriate `templates/view_forms.html` file that visualizes
   the returned value `results` from the compute function

We now want to make an app where the computed results can be stored in
a database. To this end, each user must create an account and login to
this account for archiving results and for browsing previous runs of
the application. More files are needed for this purpose, compared to
the previous apps, and the files are located in the "`vib4`":
"${github_path}/${app_path}". The `compute.py` file contains the
`compute_gamma` function from the previous app (`vib3`) in Section
ref{wf:vib3:flask:nofiles}.

The design and layout of the graphical web interface is completely
governed by template file. So far, we have used only basic HTML
elements in this file. With CSS it is possible to improve the
design, but why not adopt popular frameworks that offer an attractive
look-and-feel and much nice functionality such as responsive pages
across a wide range of devices? The "Bootstrap": "http://getbootstrap.com/"
framework is free and open software that gives developers a kick start
with respect to web page design and functionality.
Many designs are built on Bootstrap: "Bootswatch": "http:bootswatch.com",
"Start Bootstrap": "http://startbootstrap.com/",
"Bootstrap Zero": "http://bootstrapzero.com/", and "PrepBootstrap":
"http://www.prepbootstrap.com/".

It would obviously be advantageous to create Flask templates that
can utilize the Bootstrap technology. A package "Flask-Bootstrap":
"http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/"
is already supporting this idea.

!bnotice Project
  * Test out the Flask-Bootstrap package by redoing a selection
    of the previous examples with the Bootstrap design and functionality.
  * How easy is it to take advantage of various Bootstrap designs,
    say the Bootswatch themes, in a template based on Flask-Bootstrap?
  * Make a new GUI[^app] with different types of input fields and see how
    the design looks like in Bootstrap-based themes:
     * one selection from a list (radio buttons, drop-down list)
     * multiple selections from a list (check buttons)
     * one-line text field
     * multi-line text field
     * floating-point number
     * integer

[^app]: The compute function can be very simple, e.g., just returning some HTML
typesetting of the arguments. This subexercise is for test purposes
only.

======= Further work =======

 * Uploading of files: Just one button for a data file where we
   compute mean and variance, see the average function but drop
   the array argument.
 * Log in and users. use a simple "compute" function to generate
   code, just a textarea (string) that can be stored (diary).
   This requires databases. Can generate a vib example via parampool to
   display some more realistic code.
 * Drawing in HTML5
