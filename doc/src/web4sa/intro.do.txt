======= Web frameworks =======

idx{web frameworks}

Computational scientists may want to offer their applications through
a web interface, thereby making a *web application*.
Basically, this means that users can set input data
to the application on a web page, then click on some *Compute* button,
and back comes a new web page with the results of the computations.
The web interface can either be used as a GUI locally on the
scientist's computer, or the interface can be depolyed to
a server and made available to the whole world.

Web applications of the mentioned type can be created from scratch
using CGI scripts in (e.g.) Python, but the code quickly gets longer
and more involved as the complexity of the web interface
grows. Nowadays, most web applications are created with the aid of
*web frameworks*, which are software packages that simplify the
programming tasks of offering services through the Internet. The
downside of web frameworks is that there is a significant amount of
steps and details to learn before your first simple demo application
works.  The upside is that advanced applications are within reach,
without an overwhelming amount of programming, as soon as you have
understood the basic demos.

# #if TOPIC == 'Flask+Django'
We shall explore two web frameworks: the very popular "Django framework": "https://www.djangoproject.com/" and the more high-level and easy-to-use framework
"Flask": "http://flask.pocoo.org/". Our introductory examples were also
implemented in the "web2py": "http://www.web2py.com/" framework, but according
to our experience, Flask and Django are easier to explain to scientists.
The primary advantage of Django
over other web frameworks is the rich set of documentation and
examples. Googling for "Django tutorials" gives lots of hits including
a  list of "web tutorials": "https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Tutorials"
and a list of "YouTube videos": "http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL385A53B00B8B158E". There is also an electronic "Django book": "http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/". At the time of this writing, the Flask documentation is not comparable. The two most important resources are the
 "official web site": "http://flask.pocoo.org/" and the "WTForms Documentation": "http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/docs/0.6/index.html". There is, unfortunately, hardly any examples on how Django or Flask can be used to enable typical scientific applications for the web, and that is why we have developed some targeted examples on this topic.

A basic question is, of course, whether you should apply Flask or
Django for your web project. Googling for *flask vs django* gives a
lot of diverging opinions. The authors' viewpoint is that Flask is
much easier to get started with than Django. You can grow your
application to a really big one with both frameworks, but some
advanced features is easier in one framework than in the other.

# #elif TOPIC == 'Flask'
We shall in the forthcoming text explore the very easy-to-use "Flask framework":
"http://flask.pocoo.org/".  At the time of this writing, the primary Flask
documentation is the "official web site": "http://flask.pocoo.org/" and the "WTForms Documentation": "http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/docs/0.6/index.html". That is why we have made specific examples for the application of Flask in computational science.

A framework quite similar to Flask is "Bottle": "http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html".

## 2DO:
## PyORMish database interface plays well with Flask (check it out!).
##   Probably easy to store away any type of user data.
## See how easy it is to generate examples for Bottle or make
## exercises to do that.
## Comparison of micro web frameworks for Python:
## http://www.pythondiary.com/blog/Feb.14,2012/too-many-micro-webframeworks.html
## Seems that Flask is the most mature and advanced.
## CherryPy has sessions. See if Flask has something similar, more natural
## for login...

# #elif TOPIC == 'Django'
We shall explore the very popular "Django framework": "https://www.djangoproject.com/" in the following.
The primary advantage of Django
over other web frameworks is the rich set of documentation and
examples. Googling for "Django tutorials" gives lots of hits including
a  list of "web tutorials": "https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Tutorials"
and a list of "YouTube videos": "http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL385A53B00B8B158E". There is also an electronic "Django book": "http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/". However, there is hardly any example on using Django for scientific applications. The forthcoming text provides specific examples on how to webify some typical scienticic applications.

The problem for a computational scientist who wants to enable
mathematical calculations through the web is that most of
the introductory examples on utilizing a particular
web framework address web applications
of very different nature, e.g., blogs and polls. Therefore, we have made an
alternative introduction which explains, in the simplest possible way,
how web frameworks can be used to

 o generate a web page with input data to your application,
 o run the application to perform mathematical computations, and
 o generate a web page with the results of the computations.

# #if TOPIC == 'Flask+Django'
To work with Django, you need to know about Python packages and modules
as well as Python classes. With Flask it is enough to be familiar with
functions and modules, though knowledge of classes and a bit of
decorators might be an advantage.
# #elif TOPIC == 'Flask'
Flask is very easy to work with and extensive Python knowledge is
not necessary. It is in fact enough to know about functions and
modules. Beyond that, some knowledge of classes might be an advantage.
# #elif TOPIC == 'Django'
To work with Django, you need to know about Python packages, modules,
and classes.

===== The MVC pattern =====

idx{MVC pattern}

The MVC pattern stands for Model-View-Controller and is a way of
separating the user's interaction with an application from the inner
workings of the application. In a scientific application this
usually means separating mathematical computations from the
user interface and visualization of results.
The "Wikipedia definition of the MVC pattern": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVC_Pattern" gives a very high-level
explanation of what the model, view, and controller do and mentions
the fact that different web frameworks interpret the three components
differently. Any web application works with a set of data and needs
a user interface for the communication of data between the user and
some data processing software. The classical
MVC pattern introduces

 * the model to hold the data
 * the view to display the data
 * the controller to move the data by gluing the model and the view.

For applications performing mathematical computations we find it
convenient to explicitly introduce a fourth component that we call
*compute* where the mathematical computations are encapsulated.  With
the MVC pattern and the compute component we have a clear separation
between data (model), the way data is presented (view), the
computations (compute), and the way these components communicate
(controller). In a small program such a separation may look as
overkill, but it pays off in more complicated applications. More
importantly, the concepts of the MVC pattern are widely used in web
frameworks and their documentation so one should really adapt to the
MVC way of thinking.

Web frameworks often have their own way of interpreting the
model, view, and controller parts of the MVC pattern.
In particular, most frameworks often divide the view into two parts:
one software component and one HTML template. The latter takes care
of the look and feel of the web page while the former often takes
the role of being the controller too.
For our scientific applications
we shall employ an interpretation of the MVC pattern
which is compatible with what we need later on:

 * the model contains the data (often only the input data) of the application,
 * the view controls the user interface that handles input and output data,
   and also calls to functionality that computes the output given the input.

The model will be a Python class with static attributes holding the data.
The view consists of Python code processing the model's data, calling the
compute component, and specifying HTML
templates for the design of the web pages.

# #if TOPIC == 'Django'
Django generates files with names `models.py` and `views.py` so the
model and view concepts are very explicit.
The controller functionality in Django lies both in the `views.py` file and
in configuration
files (`settings.py` and `urls.py`). The view component consists of
the `views.py` file and HTML templates.
# #elif TOPIC == 'Flask'
Flask does not force any MVC pattern on the programmer, but
the code needed to build web applications can easily be split into
model, view, and controller components, and a compute
component, as will be demonstrated later.
# #elif TOPIC == 'Flask+Django'
Flask does not force any MVC pattern on the programmer, but
the code needed to build web applications can easily be split into
model, view, controller, and compute components, as will be shown later.
Django, on the other hand, automatically generates application files with names
`views.py` and `models.py` so it is
necessary to have some idea what Django means by these terms.
The controller functionality in Django lies both in the `views.py` file and
in the configuration
files (`settings.py` and `urls.py`). The view component of the application
consists both of the `views.py` file and template files used to create
the HTML code in the web pages.
# #endif

Forthcoming examples will illustrate how a scientific application is
split to meet the requirements of the MVC software design pattern.

===== A very simple application =====

## Define Mako variable for path to source code
<%
#src_path = '../../../src/apps/'
src_path = 'src-web4sa/apps/'
app_path = src_path + 'py_apps/hw_orig'
%>

We shall start with the simplest possible application,
a "scientific hello world program", where the
task is to read a number and write out "Hello, World!" followed by
the sine of the number. This application has one input variable and
a line of text as output.

Our first implementation reads the input from the command
line and writes the results to the terminal window:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/hw.py
In the terminal we can exemplify the program

!bc sys
Terminal> python hw.py 1.2
Hello, World! sin(1.2)=0.932039
!ec
The task of the web version of this program is to read the `r`
variable from a web page, compute the sine,
and write out a new web page with the resulting text.

===== Application of the MVC pattern =====
label{wf:hw:mvc}

## Define Mako variable for path to source code
<%
app_path = src_path + 'py_apps/hw_mvc'
%>

Before thinking of a web application, we first *refactor* our program
such that it fits with the classical MVC pattern and a compute component.
The refactoring does not change the functionality of the code, it
just distributes the original statements in functions and modules.
Here we create four modules: `model`, `view`,
`compute`, and `controller`.

 * The `compute` module contains a function `compute(r)` that performs
   the mathematics and returns the value `s`, which equals `sin(r)`.
 * The `model` module holds the input data, here `r`.
 * The `view` module has two functions, one for reading input data,
   `get_input`,
   and one for presenting the output, `present_output`.
   The latter takes the input, calls `compute` functionalty, and
   generates the output.
 * The `controller` module calls the view to initialize
   the model's data from the command line. Thereafter, the
   view is called to present the output.

The `model.py` file contains the `r` variable, which must
be declared with a default value in order to create the data object:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/model.py

The `view.py` file is restricted to the communication with the user and reads

@@@CODE ${app_path}/view.py

The mathematics is encapsulated in `compute.py`:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/compute.py

Finally, `controller.py` glues the model and the view:

@@@CODE ${app_path}/controller.py

Let us try our refactored code:

!bc sys
Terminal> python controller.py 1.2
Hello, World! sin(1.2)=0.932039
!ec

The next step is to create a web interface to our scientific hello world
program such that we can fill in the number `r` in a text field, click a
*Compute* button and get back a new web page with the output text
shown above: "Hello, World! sin(r)=s".
